##### Automated ELK Stack Deployment #####

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the yml file that may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

##### Description of the Topology #####

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly redundant, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.
- What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_
	Load Balancers protect the servers from Denial of Service Attacks. Jump Box is a single gateway into out system to reduce the target size for an attack.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the data and system logs.
- What does Filebeat watch for? Logs data and searches for changes
- What does Metricbeat record? Metrics and Statistics

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | VM       | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | VM       | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK-Ser  | HOST     | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

##### Access Policies ######

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- My public IP
 
Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump Box (20.248.194.253).


A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | My Personal IP       |
| Web-1    | No                  | 10.0.1.4             |
| Web-2    | No                  | 10.0.1.4             |
| Elk      | No                  | 10.0.1.4             |

##### Elk Configuration #####

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
-What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_
Saving time and minimizing erros

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker.io
- Install pip3
- Install Docker python module
- Increase virtual memory
- Download and launch a docker

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

##### Target Machines & Beats #####
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web 1 10.0.0.5
- Web 2 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat - collects data about the file system
- Metricbeat - collects machine metrics, such as uptime

##### Using the Playbook #####
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook file to Ansible Node.
- Update the hosts file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to Kibana (http://23.101.234.168:5601/app/kibana#/home) to check that the installation worked as expected.

Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:
- Which file is the playbook? filebeat-playbook.yml
	
- Where do you copy it? /etc/ansible/

- Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? /etc/ansible/hosts 

- How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? 2 separate groups: webservers - IPs of VMs where Filebeat is installed & elkservers - IP of the VM where elk is installed

- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
	http://23.101.234.168:5601/
